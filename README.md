## üïπÔ∏è so\_long

**so\_long** is a simple 2D game developed as part of the 42 programming school's curriculum. This project was completed without the bonus features.

The goal of the game is to collect all the collectibles and reach the exit, while navigating through a small map. The game uses a minimal graphics library (MiniLibX) provided by 42, and is designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts such as:

* File handling and map parsing
* Memory management in C
* Basic game loop logic
* Event handling (keyboard input)
* Window and image rendering

### üöß Features

* 2D map loaded from a `.ber` file
* Real-time movement using keyboard controls (W/A/S/D)
* Collectibles must be picked up before reaching the exit
* Basic input validation and error handling
* No bonus (no enemies, animations, or multiple maps)

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* Language: C
* Graphics: MiniLibX (a simplified X-Window library used at 42)
* OS: Linux
